This project is a custom shell program that provides essential command-line functionalities, including displaying files in the current directory, changing to the home and root directories, and showing a usage message for user guidance. It also features background process management with notifications and supports sending signals to specific processes, allowing users to execute commands like kill and sleep on targeted process IDs. Designed to demonstrate key operating system concepts such as process control, signal handling, and directory navigation, this shell offers a simplified yet functional environment for both learning and practical use.
